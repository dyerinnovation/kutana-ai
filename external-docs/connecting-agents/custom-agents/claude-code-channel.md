# Claude Code Channel

Connect Claude Code to Convene AI meetings as a first-class participant. The Convene channel plugin runs as a local stdio MCP server — it pushes real-time meeting events into your Claude Code session and provides tools for interacting with the meeting.

## How it works

The Convene channel plugin is an MCP server that Claude Code spawns as a subprocess. It:

1. **Authenticates** with the Convene API using your agent API key
2. **Exposes tools** for listing, joining, and interacting with meetings
3. **Pushes events** — transcript segments, chat messages, speaker changes, and extracted insights arrive in Claude's context as `<channel>` tags in real time

Events arrive as XML tags like this:

```xml
<channel source="convene-ai" topic="transcript" type="transcript_segment">
[2.0s-4.5s] Alice: We should finalize the API spec by Thursday.
</channel>

<channel source="convene-ai" topic="chat" type="chat_message">
[2026-03-31T23:33:25Z] Bob: Sounds good, I'll handle the review.
</channel>
```

Claude reads these and can respond using the meeting tools — sending chat messages, raising a hand to speak, claiming tasks, and more.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** (latest version)
- **Bun** runtime v1.0+ ([bun.sh](https://bun.sh))
- A **Convene API key**

## Setup

### 1. Create an agent and get an API key

1. Sign in to your Convene instance (e.g. `https://convene.spark-b0f2.local`)
2. Navigate to **Agents**
3. Click **Create New Agent** — give it a name like "Claude Code"
4. Select the capabilities your agent needs (listen, voice, text chat, etc.)
5. Click **Create Agent**
6. On the agent detail page, find the **API Keys** section
7. Click **Generate Key** — give it a name (e.g. "my-macbook")
8. **Copy the key immediately** — it starts with `cvn_` and is only shown once

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd /path/to/convene-ai/services/channel-server
bun install
```

### 3. Configure Claude Code

Add the Convene channel to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "convene": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["/path/to/convene-ai/services/channel-server/src/server.ts"],
      "env": {
        "CONVENE_API_KEY": "cvn_your_key_here",
        "CONVENE_API_URL": "wss://convene.spark-b0f2.local/ws",
        "CONVENE_HTTP_URL": "https://convene.spark-b0f2.local/api",
        "CONVENE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0",
        "CONVENE_AGENT_NAME": "Claude Code"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/convene-ai` with the actual path to your repository, and paste your API key.

### 4. Restart Claude Code

Close and reopen Claude Code (or start a new session). Verify the plugin loaded:

```
/mcp
```

You should see `convene` listed with 18 tools available.

## Usage

### List and join a meeting

```
You:          What meetings are available?

Claude Code:  [calls list_meetings]
              Found 2 meetings:
              - "Architecture Review" (active) — 5ccf4fbd-...
              - "Weekly Standup" (scheduled) — b419d06f-...

You:          Join the Architecture Review.

Claude Code:  [calls join_meeting]
              Joined. Receiving real-time transcript and events.
```

### Create and join

```
You:          Start a meeting called "Sprint Planning".

Claude Code:  [calls join_or_create_meeting]
              Created and joined "Sprint Planning".
```

### Interact during a meeting

Once joined, transcript and chat events flow into Claude's context automatically. Claude can respond:

```
You:          What action items have come up?

Claude Code:  [calls get_meeting_recap]
              3 tasks identified so far:
              1. Alice — finalize API spec by Thursday
              2. Bob — schedule infrastructure review
              3. Unassigned — update deployment docs

You:          Claim the docs task and let the meeting know.

Claude Code:  [calls accept_task, then reply]
              Task accepted. Sent: "I'll take the deployment docs update."
```

### Leave

```
You:          Leave the meeting.

Claude Code:  [calls leave_meeting]
              Left meeting 5ccf4fbd-...
```

| `meeting_lifecycle` | Meeting join/leave | `<channel source="convene-ai" topic="meeting_lifecycle">Joined meeting abc-123.</channel>` |

## Agent modes

Control which events Claude receives by setting `CONVENE_AGENT_MODE`:

| `transcript` | Transcript segments only |
| `insights` | Extracted entities only |
| `both` | Both transcript and insights (default) |
| `selective` | Insights of specific types only |

For selective mode, set `CONVENE_ENTITY_FILTER` to a comma-separated list:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CONVENE_AGENT_MODE": "selective",
    "CONVENE_ENTITY_FILTER": "task,decision,blocker"
  }
}
```

Available entity types: `task`, `decision`, `question`, `entity_mention`, `key_point`, `blocker`, `follow_up`.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code
    │
    └── stdio MCP ──→ Convene Channel Plugin (bun)
                          │
                          ├── HTTP (fetch) ──→ API Server   (list/create meetings)
                          └── WebSocket    ──→ Agent Gateway (join, events, chat, turn)
```

The channel plugin authenticates on startup, exposes tools for meeting discovery, and opens a WebSocket to the agent gateway when you join a meeting. Gateway events are translated into `notifications/claude/channel` messages that arrive in Claude's context as `<channel source="convene-ai">` tags.
